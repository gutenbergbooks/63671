<p><i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">Archaeology</a></i><a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> has a number of popular stereotypes
usually involving expeditions to remote parts
of the Earth in search of ancient tombs, lost cities or
long-extinct races of Man. The <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeologist">archaeologist</a></i> is
seen working a &ldquo;dig&rdquo; for years, looking for bits of
bone or stone of little importance to anyone but
other scientists.</p>
<p>In reality, however, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a> departs from this
picture considerably. Many modern archaeologists
work in their own communities on projects that
include things familiar to most of us. The scope of
their studies may range from 10,000 year old
American Indian <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a></i> to early twentieth century
farms. Excavations are carried out with the aid of
tools, including small dental instruments, large
earth-moving machines, and electronic computers.
Often, archaeologists do not dig at all, but gather
information from maps, photographs, written histories,
and living informants. In fact, more time by
far is spent working on <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifact">artifacts</a></i> in a laboratory, and
especially in writing reports of excavations, than is
spent in the field. Even more surprising, many
archaeologists today work in cooperation with private
and governmental agencies to protect archaeological remains,
as required by state and federal
laws. A specialized field of archaeology, called
<i>public</i> or <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_ConservationArchaeology">conservation archaeology</a></i>, has come into
existence in the last twenty years to meet this need.</p>
<p>The archaeological studies in the Richland Creek
Reservoir area are a good example of <a class="gloss" href="#g_ConservationArchaeology">conservation archaeology</a> in
action. This report explains what the
Richland Creek Archaeological Project (RCAP) is,
how it works, and what it has accomplished thus far.
Above all, the report tries to show why conservation of
our archaeological heritage is important to us all,
and to future generations.</p>
<p>A series of archaeological studies are planned for
the Richland-Chambers Dam and Reservoir area
near Corsicana, Texas (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The first phase of
those studies was carried out during 1980-81. The
Tarrant County Water Control and Improvement
District Number 1, developer of the Reservoir,
employed Southern Methodist University<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
to conduct archaeological studies. Like other construction
projects requiring state and federal permits, the
Reservoir cannot be completed unless state and
federal laws pertaining to archaeological and historical
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> are adhered to. Since 1906, several federal
and state laws have been enacted to protect important
archaeological sites. Particularly during the last
two decades, these laws have defined archaeological remains as
an important cultural resource that
should be conserved for future generations.</p>
<p>In recent decades legislators and the public have
come to realize that the expansion of our urban-industrial
society is rapidly destroying the <i>archaeological resources</i> of
the country. In many regions
of the United States this destruction has reached
crisis proportions. Experts point out that within
another generation, given current rates of resource
destruction from industry, agriculture, and other
land-modification projects, intact archaeological resources
will virtually cease to exist within large
areas of the nation.</p>
<p>Archaeological resources are fragile and nonrenewable.
Much of the scientific value of archaeological resources is lost if they cannot be studied in
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
an undisturbed <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Context">context</a></i>. Objects excavated from a
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">site</a> have little meaning unless they can be related to
specific soil layers (<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Stratigraphy">stratigraphy</a></i>) and other evidence
of former activities of people, such as hearths,
trash deposits, house remains and other <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Feature">features</a></i>.
Any activity that disturbs the soil may destroy this
context.</p>

<p>The primary objective of archaeologists working
in <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_CulturalResourceManagement">cultural resource management</a></i> is <i>archaeological conservation</i>.
As in the case of other non-renewable
natural resources, the emphasis is on resource
preservation. In the case of archaeological <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a>, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
means digging as a last resort. The first priority of
the conservation <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeologist">archaeologist</a> is to preserve in an
intact state a reasonable number of archaeological sites for
future generations of scientists and the
public. Sometimes sites can be preserved by selecting
a construction design which avoids them. In
other instances adverse impact is unavoidable&mdash;a
case in which excavations are carried out to recover
scientific information contained in the sites prior to
their destruction. Recovery of this information is
one way of conserving the resource. Preservation
through <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_DataRecovery">data recovery</a></i> will be required in the Reservoir,
and will be the focus of work in years to come.</p>
<h3 id="c2">ARCHAEOLOGISTS AT WORK</h3>
<p>One way of understanding the RCAP is to look at
how archaeologists work. People frequently ask
what is an archaeological <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">site</a>? How do you find
sites? How do you excavate and what do you look
for? What do you do with the things that you collect?</p>
<p>During 1980-81, an <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_ArchaeologicalSurvey">archaeological survey</a></i> (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>)
was completed in the project area. During the
survey, an effort was made to develop the most
complete inventory possible of <i>prehistoric</i> and <i>historic</i>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a>. Sites were recorded by examining the
entire project area on foot, consulting landowners,
amateur archaeologists, written records, museum
collections, aerial photographs, and other sources of
information. No survey could guarantee discovery
of every archaeological site, but every effort was
made to construct a representative picture of the
archaeological resources in the project. Next, limited-scale
excavations (<i>testing</i>) were conducted on a
sample of sites that were thought to contain information
best suited to answering specific scientific
questions. Once more, the intent was not to dig
every site, but to understand a representative sample
of archaeological resources within the project.</p>
<p>Archaeologists find <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> by a variety of means.
Naturally, how one defines an archaeological site
has an important bearing on what is considered as
representative. In the Reservoir, a site was defined
as any evidence of past human occupation, predating
1930. The 1930 cut-off date reflects a legal
definition of sites in the National Register of Historic places, a federal office that records important
historical and archaeological properties. To be
eligible for inclusion in the Register, a site must
generally be at least 50 years old, and must meet a
number of other criteria. Applying this definition to
archaeological sites, they may be as different as
isolated pieces of prehistoric stone tools and an
early twentieth century farm house. Why such
concern for these seemingly isolated tools or for
dwellings that are so recent? One of the things that
archaeologists have learned is that sometimes bits of
information that are incomprehensible taken one at
a time form meaningful patterns when many pieces
are put together.</p>
<p>For example, it has been learned that when
isolated <i>projectile points</i> dropped by prehistoric hunters are plotted on a map, their distribution may
correlate with patterns of vegetation or topography,
giving clues about the kinds of animals that they
were hunting and the size of their hunting territories.
More recent things, such as old farm houses, are
worth recording because, as we discuss later, they
represent the remnants of a way of life that is largely
gone from rural Texas. In another generation these
buildings, so familiar as to escape notice by most of
us, will be gone for the most part, victims of decay,
vandalism, and land modification. To future generations,
these &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifact">artifacts</a>&rdquo; will be of as much interest as
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
nineteenth century houses are to us today. There is a
danger that what is so common to us will fail to be
recorded. Contrary to what many suppose, the
rather common aspects of early twentieth century
Texas culture are most in danger of being lost
without adequate record. Often histories and other
documents reflect the lives and architecture of the
wealthy and well-known rather than the common
people. Still, the buildings and farms of the latter
reflect distinctive regional styles, and tell us many
interesting things about the lives of the people who
built and lived in them.</p>

</div>
<p>Once we know what we are looking for, actually
finding <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> requires a variety of methods. The most
effective technique is the trained observer walking
over the ground. <a class="gloss" href="#g_PrehistoricSites">Prehistoric sites</a>, that is sites
occupied prior to written history in the project area
(about A.D. 1650), can be found by observing
distinctive bits of stone (<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Debitage">debitage</a></i>) produced during
manufacture and use of stone tools. Before contact
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
with Europeans, the Indians of Texas had no metals
for making tools, and relied upon stone for many
kinds of implements. In other instances, pieces of
prehistoric pottery (<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Potsherds">potsherds</a></i>), animal bone or
shell, or stained soil deposits (<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Midden">middens</a></i>) signal
prehistoric sites. Many of these clues are easily
overlooked except by a trained <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeologist">archaeologist</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to ground survey, aerial photographs
and geological studies may be helpful in finding
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a>. In the RCAP, for example, a soils scientist
studied the geological history of the project area, and
was able to give the archaeologists a good idea
where and how deeply archaeological sites might be
buried. One of the most valuable means of locating
archaeological sites was talking to local people and
amateur archaeologists. Many of these people are
keen observers and reported the location of many
prehistoric and historic sites.</p>
<p>Excavating <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> is a complex task. There is no
single technique for digging. The kinds of methods
employed vary from excavation of <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_TestPits">test pits</a></i> or
<i>trenches</i> with shovels and trowels, to making larger
exposures with heavy equipment. Sometimes the
shape and placement of these excavations is determined
by statistical sampling considerations; and
they are always conditioned by the specific information
that the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeologist">archaeologist</a> hopes to get from a
site. That is really the most important point: excavations
are aimed at recovering information, not
things per se. As we pointed out earlier in the
mention of archaeological <a class="gloss" href="#g_Context">context</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifact">artifacts</a> have
little meaning taken out of their setting. This fact
creates one of the most striking aspects of an
archaeological excavation to many people. There is
a tremendous amount of record keeping that goes on
in a dig&mdash;maps of the site and of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_TestPits">test pit</a> walls
(<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Profiles">profiles</a></i>), sheets describing artifacts and soil characteristics,
photographs and many others (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).
The object is to keep enough records that, if
necessary, the archaeological site could be reconstructed
in detail. A parallel set of record keeping
comes into play, too, once things from the field reach
the archaeological lab.</p>
<p>The demanding nature of excavation is a good
reason why the untrained should not attempt to
excavate <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a>. Without proper controls, digging can
only result in loss of archaeological resources.
Those who are interested in learning proper archaeological methods can
contact organizations listed at
the end of this report (<a href="#c13">Appendix I</a>).</p>
<p>People invariably want to know what happens to
the things that are collected by archaeologists. Do
archaeologists add <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifact">artifacts</a> to their private collections,
for example? Among professional archaeologists,
keeping of private collections is actively
discouraged. The reason for this is that archaeological remains are considered a scientific and
public resource that should not be held for personal
reasons. As scientists, archaeologists are interested
in artifacts as sources of information rather than as
objects with intrinsic value. All artifacts collected in
the Reservoir, as is the case with all <a class="gloss" href="#g_ConservationArchaeology">conservation archaeology</a> projects, will be stored in permanent
institutional repositories, where they can be studied
by future generations of scientists. Also, plans are
underway to return some of this material to the local
area in the form of a museum display, for the benefit
of the public.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE RICHLAND-CHAMBERS RESERVOIR</span></h2>
<h3 id="c4"><i>PREHISTORIC PAST</i></h3>
<p>Recent studies suggest that humans have occupied
North America for at least 20,000 years.
These prehistoric Indians were the first people to
live in North America, probably entering the New
World first by way of a great land bridge between
what is now Siberia and Alaska. True pioneers, they
entered a vast land that had never before contained
humans. Once in the New World, their culture
developed over thousands of years into several
successive stages and spread over the whole of
North America and into South America. In the
United States the development of prehistoric American
Indian cultures is a fascinating story of a
people&rsquo;s increasingly complex culture and adaptations
to the wealth of natural resources offered by
our continent. Since this development occurred
before these people developed systems of writing,
their history is available to us only through <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a>
and other sciences. Without an effort to
understand this story, the history of a whole people
will disappear without record.</p>
<p>The peopling of the New World represents a kind
of huge laboratory for understanding how human
societies develop over long periods of time. Since
the first people in North America entered a new land
that did not contain human competitors except
themselves, we can study the development of their
culture over thousands of years in a relatively simple
frame of analysis. Archaeologists currently recognize
four basic culture stages of prehistoric Indian
development in North America. These stages are
represented, in varying ways and degrees, by the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a> of the Richland-Chambers project.</p>
<h3 id="c5"><i>The Paleo-Indian Stage</i>
<br />(<i>18,000 to 8000 B.C.</i>)</h3>
<p>Since 1925, when flint spear points were found
embedded in the bones of a kind of long-extinct
bison, scientists have known that Native Americans
lived in this country for tens-of-thousands of years.
We call these people the &ldquo;Paleo&rdquo; Indians, after the
Greek word for ancient, to refer to the oldest
inhabitants of this continent. Intriguing as these
people are, however, we understand little about
them because we have found few traces of their
habitations. The most distinctive trait of these
people is chipped stone spear points with characteristic
&ldquo;flutes,&rdquo; or long flake scars, on their surfaces
(probably helping to lash the spear point to a
shaft). These are unlike anything made by their
descendants over the thousands of years to follow.
Beautifully made, these <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifact">artifacts</a> are obviously stone
tools of hunters, who depended on their weapons for
a livelihood (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).</p>
<p>At first, it appears that the population grew slowly
in the newly-inhabited continent of North America.
The people in this period were apparently nomadic,
frequently moving in search of game animals, seasonal
plant foods and raw materials. Since there
were not many of them, and they moved frequently,
they did not leave many remains for the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeologist">archaeologist</a>
to find. In the project area, only the base
portion of a fluted point has been found but this
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifact">artifact</a> is an unmistakable but faint clue to the
presence of Paleo-Indian inhabitants. With further
work, more evidence may come to light. As matters
now stand, we understand little of these people&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
economy, religion, society, settlement pattern and
other things that made up their culture.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 4. Drawing of a Paleo-Indian fluted point (Clovis type).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c6"><i>The Archaic Stage</i>
<br />(<i>8000 B.C. to A.D. 1?</i>)</h3>
<p>Following the Paleo-Indian stage of cultural development,
we know that population continued to
grow steadily over thousands of years. We know this
trend occurred because we find many more <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a>. In
the project area, for example, we find that about half
of all <a class="gloss" href="#g_PrehistoricSites">prehistoric sites</a> that can be related to a cultural stage are
from the Archaic stage (over 300 prehistoric sites were recorded
during 1980-81). Even
though these sites were occupied over thousands of
years, they are a striking contrast to the scanty
evidence of Paleo-Indian groups.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes it easier to find Archaic
stage <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> is that the Archaic peoples&rsquo; way of life
had changed from that of the Paleo-Indians. The
hallmark of Archaic culture was a round of occupation
from one site to another in a regular cycle timed
to the changing seasons. We suspect, for example,
that during the fall, families moved to camps on river
terraces where they could gather acorns and other
nuts for winter food and hunt deer. In the spring and
summer, they may have moved to camps on streams,
where they could fish and gather roots, berries and
mussels. By coming back to their sites again and
again over hundreds or thousands of years, a great
deal of waste materials was deposited leaving evidence
to be found by archaeologists.</p>
<p>At present, only the barest outline of this culture is
understood. Yet through study of their burial patterns,
discarded food materials and many other
aspects of the archaeological <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> they left behind,
we can come to a much fuller understanding of their
culture (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).</p>
<h3 id="c7"><i>The Woodland Stage</i>
<br />(<i>A.D. 1 to A.D. 800?</i>)</h3>
<p>Throughout much of eastern North America we
know that tremendous cultural changes occurred in
the few centuries before and after the time of Christ.
The society of simple hunters and gatherers in
Archaic times gave way to a much more advanced
type of society for reasons that are not entirely
understood at present. We do know that Woodland
stage peoples began building huge earthworks; sometimes
as burial mounds, sometimes in the forms of
animals such as snakes. From a social point of view,
big changes occurred. We find the first evidence of
social ranking in which a few powerful people were
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
buried in mounds with great wealth and ceremony.
In certain respects, this development was a clear
step toward the eventual emergence of civilizations.
We know that this kind of change has occurred
independently in many parts of the world but we do
not yet know why. It is clearly an important development
with consequences for all human societies.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p04a.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="793" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 5. Projectile points excavated from an Archaic stage <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">site</a> in the Richland project. Some of the stone from which these
points were made was imported by the Indians from many miles away from the project.</p>
</div>
<p>The Woodland stage also saw major technological
advances. It was in this period that the bow
and arrow, making of pottery (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>) and agriculture
(though this may have occurred during
Archaic times, too) make their appearance.</p>
<p>The interesting aspect of the project area is that
some of these things (e.g., the bow and arrow and
pottery) appear to have been adopted, but not
others, including the settled village life, agriculture,
earth works and social complexity of other prehistoric peoples to
the east and north (e.g., the prehistoric Caddo Indians). In many ways, it appears that
the relatively simpler life of Archaic times persisted,
with a few items borrowed from more advanced
outsiders. This pattern is one that deserves an
explanation.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><i>Neo-American Stage</i>
<br />(<i>A.D. 800 to 1500</i>)</h3>
<p>The Neo-American stage, also called the Mississippian
stage in the eastern U.S., was the last
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
prehistoric culture stage, and the one with the most
complex culture. During this stage, large pyramid-shaped
earthen mounds, complex ceremonialism,
long-distance trade, heavy reliance on crops such as
corn and squash, and a complex social order, with
powerful chiefs at the top of the ranking system, all
merged. The prehistoric Caddo Indians of East
Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana are an
excellent example of this type of culture.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="883" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 6. Pieces of prehistoric earthen pottery (<a class="gloss" href="#g_Potsherds">potsherds</a>) that were made during the Neo-American cultural stage in the project.
Note the different types of surface decorations.</p>
</div>
<p>Yet, for all of the vigor and influence of this type of
culture, its influence was not felt to the same degree
everywhere. In the project area, there are only a few
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> that suggest substantial contact with the most
developed Neo-American cultures. In those cases
we find certain kinds of prehistoric pottery vessels
that, if not actually obtained from more culturally
advanced peoples to the east and north, were
modelled after ceramics of neighboring peoples.</p>
<p>These facts raise many questions. Were the
inhabitants of the project area during Neo-American
times carrying on an older style of life, modelled
economically after the earlier Archaic-type of economy?
Were the resources available in the project
insufficient to support a thoroughly agricultural type
of economy? Equipped only with simple hand tools,
only certain kinds of soils allowed agriculture by
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
these ancient peoples. The tough prairie grasses, for
example, would have made certain kinds of soils
difficult, if not impossible to cultivate.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p05a.jpg" alt="" width="628" height="1000" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 7. This trench is one of those excavated in two &ldquo;Wylie
focus&rdquo; pits discovered in the project. Since these
prehistoric pits are about 100 feet in diameter, it is
difficult to show their extent in a photograph. Much
information on the age, construction sequence and
content of the pits was gained from <a class="gloss" href="#g_TestTrenches">test trenches</a> such
as this one.</p>
</div>
<p>There is also the question of environmental
influences. We know that over a period of thousands
of years the climate of Texas, in fact of all of North
America, has changed a great deal. Part of the ongoing
research in the RCAP is the study of past
environments. Some of the most promising results
here are from the fields of geology and palynology
(the study of pollen records). Many people do not
know that pollen from ancient plants may be preserved
in the soil for thousands of years, and can be
recovered with certain laboratory methods. If this
pollen from past periods is found, it can help to
understand the kinds of vegetation that were present
at different points in time. The present evidence
from the project is exciting. It suggests, for example,
that a drought far worse than anything recorded in
the history of Texas occurred sometime between
A.D. 1000 to 1300. The severity of the drought may
have caused prehistoric people to change their way
of life, including abandoning the project area.</p>
<p>Another major scientific discovery has been made
in the project, and is dated to the Neo-American
stage. For forty years archaeologists have known
that an area on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River,
north of Dallas, contained large, man-made pits
dating to the Neo-American stage. These were
called Wylie focus pits, after a system of classification
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> used by archaeologists. These pits are
truly large, some measuring up to 100 feet in
diameter and up to 10 feet deep in the center (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>).
Moreover, these pits generally contain many
human burials placed in the pit over a period of time.
One pit even contained the skeleton of a young bear.
All of these pits were excavated by hand with simple
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
digging implements.</p>
<p>During the Richland project&rsquo;s first season of work
two of these pits were located and excavated. The
discovery of these pits extended the known range of
these unique cultural <a class="gloss" href="#g_Feature">features</a> over 100 miles from
the region of their original occurrence.</p>
<p>At present, it is unclear what prehistoric culture
constructed these monumental works or what their
function may have been. It is safe to say, however,
that these kinds of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> are unique to the north Texas
area, and constitute a major point of archaeological interest. Work will be continuing on these sites in the
next few years.</p>
<h3 id="c9"><i>HISTORIC PAST</i></h3>
<p>The archaeological story of people in this area
during the last 150 years is no less exciting than its
prehistoric counterpart. From the material remains,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a>, and structures that these people have left
behind, we see a picture of the rapid taming of a
frontier, its rural agricultural florescence at the turn
of this century, and then its decline under adverse
economic conditions. Much of the rural landscape
still contains a significant percentage of early twentieth
century structures in varying degrees of abandonment
and preservation. The following sections
briefly look at the archaeological record for the
historic period in the RCAP area as we know it
today. The archaeological record provides us with a
tangible and materially rich picture of specific
aspects of daily life. The record left behind by the
area&rsquo;s past inhabitants provides much detailed information
about their dwellings, farms, personal belongings,
daily activities and lifeways. Although we
have only begun to decipher the information, some
results are already available from the 194 <a class="gloss" href="#g_HistoricSites">historic sites</a> tested
and the several dozen individuals interviewed
to date.</p>
<p>Before entering into a discussion of the historic period, let us step back from the results and answer
several major questions. What important and unique
qualities emerge from the historic archaeological record for this area? Does the record tell us the same
story that it would for other areas? What insight does
the record provide that is distinct and unique to this
part of Texas?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not much is available from other
areas of the country for making comparisons to the
study area, but from what is known a general picture
can be formed. The rural communities in this area
consisted mainly of farms from the mid-nineteenth
century to the early twentieth century. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a>
representing these former farms indicate that lifeways
were amazingly stable and relatively unaffected
by influences coming from urban cultures.
Since 1940, however, much of the distinctive culture
of this rural area, unfortunately, has succumbed
to the same urban American values found over other
broad regions. The archaeological record suggests
that before mass transportation and electricity entered
the local scene, this area would have ranked
among the richest of late nineteenth century areas in
terms of local folk cultures and rural lifeways.
Today, much of the rural culture has been lost. An
objective of the Richland Creek Archaeological Project has been to record some of this information
through interviews with senior residents over the
next several years.</p>
<p>Results of some of the work conducted in the
study of past lifeways portray the area&rsquo;s past residents
as a group of people who often made efficient
and wise use of their local natural resources. This is
illustrated in one aspect of their building construction.
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
As bottomland forests were cut and less wood
was available locally, many individuals adopted the
practice of recycling major elements of older structures
into new ones. <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a> is an example of
recycling older beams. Reuse of older structures
underscores a keen awareness of optimizing local
resources. Undoubtedly, other examples of the
efficient use of local resources will emerge as
structures and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> are studied in greater detail.</p>

<h3 id="c10"><i>A Look at the Past Through Material Remains</i></h3>
<p>What can we expect to gain from looking at
broken pieces of plates, bottles, animal bones,
buttons, and window glass 50 or a 100 years old?
Aren&rsquo;t museum collections and written histories
adequate for providing information about rural life
from 1870 to 1910? Unfortunately, there is a big
difference between the type of information available
through antiques, books, people, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifact">Artifacts</a> represent fragments generally resulting
from the discarding or breaking of common items.
Most antiques represent whole items recognized as
having some intrinsic value which afforded them
greater care or curation and less utilitarian usage.
Most artifacts, on the other hand, represent common
household items or possessions that did not receive
special care or handling. No fragments of elaborately
cut crystal wine glasses were among the
30,000 historic artifacts recovered from the project
area, but fragments of inexpensive, undecorated
tumblers were present. Similarly, only several dozen
fragments of porcelain vessels were among the
nearly 1,200 ceramic fragments excavated. Does
this mean that cut wine glasses or porcelain cups
were seldom available? No, more likely it represents
a difference in handling and caring for these
more expensive items. As an example, try counting
the number of porcelain tablewares (plates, dishes,
cups, etc.) in the household of an elderly person. In
most cases, porcelain will be very frequent and often
50 years old or even older. These items have been
saved from common use and now serve decorative
or very special functions. The point of this example
is to emphasize that the items fifty or more years old
in households or museums today are not representative
of the items lying broken and scattered
around <a class="gloss" href="#g_HistoricSites">historic sites</a>.</p>
<p>Can the written record provide us with much of
the information we need to know? The richness of
the written record is not to be underrated. However,
in many areas, the written record is not without its
problems. Often objective details about daily activities
or observations about common material possessions,
farm layouts, folkways or folk technologies
are hard to locate. Diaries, travelers&rsquo; accounts,
and written histories, on the other hand, frequently
provide interesting personal or anecdotal kinds of
information. The position that archaeologists wish
to emphasize is that we should not rely solely on the
written record in an attempt to understand the past.
The picture conveyed for a group of people from
their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> and material remains can be strikingly
different from their own story told in writings. The
archaeological record provides a direct and often
objective source of information which is consistent
over long periods of time. The record of your own
life as revealed in the items you discard may be quite
different than what you portray to others. This fact
makes some aspects of the archaeological record
both interesting and important for reconstructing
past lifeways.</p>
<p>These major points all contribute to the value of
the archaeological record. For nineteenth century
rural East-central Texas, written records, oral folk
knowledge, and antiques leave much of the story
untold. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a> of <a class="gloss" href="#g_HistoricSites">historic sites</a> in the
proposed Reservoir area will begin to illuminate
much of the former lifeways of these small rural
agricultural communities. Without preserving some
of this information, future generations will have little
to study in order to probe the past of this nearly 100
square miles. The displacement of people and the
submergence of places and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> so familiar today
means oblivion for many former homesteads and
communities. The task of the historic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeologist">archaeologist</a>
is to select and preserve important aspects of the
past record so that this information is available to
future generations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h3 id="c11"><i>Historic Settlement Along Richland and Chambers Creeks (1840-1940)</i></h3>
<p>The first few permanent settlers came to this area
soon after Texas declared its independence from
Mexico in 1836. Settlement increased tremendously
after Texas achieved statehood as families
migrated westward. Most of these earliest settlers
constructed log cabins for dwellings. About ten log
cabin <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> possibly dating to the mid-nineteenth
century have been located in the area. Overall,
however, we see a picture of families with widely
different resources facing the same rural frontier. On
the upper end were relatively affluent frontier plantation
owners, such as the Burlesons and Blackmons,
who settled along Richland Creek, or the Ingrams
along the Trinity River to the north. The location of
these affluent households were similar. They were
located well above the creek bottoms and in the
vicinity of good cotton land. Even the crude plantation
houses themselves were similar in that each
presented an air of important social status. Through
the architecture of these dwellings each owner
presented a visual display of his personal wealth and
social status. Although these houses were far less
sophisticated than those found further east in Louisiana
or Mississippi, they were the mark of status in
this area. The Burleson plantation house is shown in
Figures <a href="#fig9">9</a> and <a href="#fig10">10</a>. Compared to the simple, small,
unpretentious log cabin shown in <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>, the
crude frontier plantation house of East-central Texas
fulfilled its social role as needed.</p>
<p>In the reservoir area, the former <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> of several
simple log cabins have been found. <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a> shows
the remains of one log cabin as found today. These
sites indicate that life was orderly yet simple during
the mid-nineteenth century. The settlers that came
to this area were, for the most part, experienced in
reading the land. The locations selected for each
cabin were well above the bottomlands in order to
avoid the danger of floods, but at the same time close
to rich farmland and water. Fifty years later people
were much less concerned about selecting the proper
location for a dwelling. As a consequence, many
log cabins have endured over a century of harsh
weather and have outlasted more recent structures.</p>
<p>By 1870, several dozen small communities,
(Petty&rsquo;s Chapel, Birdston, Rush Creek, Wadeville,
Pisgah Ridge, Rural Shade, Re, and Providence)
dotted the landscape. The railroad penetrated the
area in 1871 and brought about many changes in the
area that have lasted until today. There was, however,
a price to be paid for this modern convenience
of trade and travel. For some of the small communities,
the railroad brought financial death and
abandonment. The archaeological record shows this
pattern clearly. New communities seem to have
grown up overnight (e.g., Richland, Navarro,
Cheneyboro, Streetman, and Kerens) while others,
which had been around for 30 or 40 years, deteriorated
rapidly (e.g. Wadeville, Pisgah Ridge, Winkler,
and Re).</p>
<p>In addition to causing a shift in rural populations,
the railroads also brought another major change.
Prior to the railroads, these rural communities had
become nearly self sufficient. The remains of a kiln
for firing hand made bricks found in the project area
stands as an example of rural folk industry (some
fragments of glazed handmade bricks from the kiln
are shown in <a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a>). Other craftsmen also may
have been dispersed over this rural countryside. The
shoe last (iron form used in shoe repair) found at one
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">site</a> suggests that a rural cobbler may have once
stayed at the site (<a href="#fig14">Figure 14</a>). The railroads symbolized
the start of a new era where mass produced
goods, brick, lumber, shoes and commercial products
could be transported cheaply into the area.
Along with these goods came better living conditions
and prosperity for many farmers and merchants.
As a consequence some rural folk industries
such as brick making disappeared and were replaced
by commercial establishments. Even the need for a
rural cobbler may have been eclipsed by the railroads.</p>

<p>The archaeological record shows another effect
of railroads on the local residents. Investigations so
far suggest that there was an increase in the consumption
of such items as bottles (<a href="#fig15">Figure 15</a>), plates
(<a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a>), personal possessions and the like in the
few decades after the railroads entered this area. By
the early twentieth century, the archaeological record suggests
that rural households had been partly,
but not entirely incorporated into the patterns of
commercial consumption. It seems that many were
able to retain some of their rural folkways well into
the twentieth century.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 14. Iron shoe last used in cobbler work from a <a class="gloss" href="#g_HistoricSites">historic site</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The battle played locally between rural American
lifeways and their urban counterparts may be inferred
from a close look at the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a>, structures, and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifact">artifacts</a> these people have left behind. For example,
the pattern of intensive yard use by families in this
area remains unchanged until well into the twentieth
century. Many fragments of pottery and glass lie
scattered around these rural dwellings. In other
more settled parts of the country, such as the
northeast, rural farmers had shifted away from this
pattern of intensive yard use toward a pattern
reflecting commercial consumption. In the Reservoir
area, swept dirt yards were still being used for
various daily activities, from processing food to
discarding refuse, while cosmetically treated and
manicured lawns were being kept in New England,
New York, and much of the mid-Atlantic region. In
this regard, domestic life in much of East-central
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Texas had changed very little. In other parts of the
country, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a> reveals dramatic reorganization
to keep pace with a society moving towards
increased consumption and disposable material culture.
Denser rural populations and a greater consumption
of disposable material culture forced many
communities to organize town dumps and mass
collections to cope with the excess products. The
Richland Creek area did not experience this transition
until well into the twentieth century. Lower
population density and a stronger tie to more
traditional lifeways kept many aspects of rural life
the same until the advent of better roads and
electricity in the mid-1930s.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p08b.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="674" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 15. Late nineteenth and early twentieth century bottle fragments recovered from <a class="gloss" href="#g_HistoricSites">historic sites</a> in the project area.</p>
</div>
<p>The persistence of an unpretentious and traditional
aspect of rural life in this area can be observed
in the dwellings found throughout. The <i>Cumberland</i>
and <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_HippedRoofBungalow">Hipped Roof Bungalows</a></i> found here reveal a
blend of traditional southern lifeways and local folk
elements. Figures <a href="#fig17">17</a> and <a href="#fig18">18</a> show two examples of
early twentieth century dwellings. <a href="#fig19">Figure 19</a> illustrates
the traditional cultural overtones of this region
and shows an early twentieth century log barn.</p>
<p>Several other aspects of traditional Southern
lifeways have been captured in the archaeological record. The
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">sites</a> in the Richland Creek area indicate
that foodways did not change as quickly in this area
as in others. For example, the archaeological record
suggests that home canning with commercial fruit
canning (<a href="#fig20">Figure 20</a>) jars was slow to penetrate this
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
area. Wide use of glass fruit jars does not appear
until the second decade of this century, unlike other
parts of the country that used them as early as 1870
or 1880.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 16. Fragments of late nineteenth and early twentieth century ceramics. The printed marks designate the manufacturer.
The mark seen in the top row is typical of many late nineteenth century British potteries.</p>
</div>
<p>Last of all, the consumption of commercially
produced alcoholic beverages, liquors, and patent
medicines does not appear to be anywhere near that
observed in the refuse discarded by contemporaneous
residents of the northeast or frontier southwest.
Whether this indicates local adherence to
southern temperance or the widespread use of
&ldquo;homemade&rdquo; products is not known at this time.</p>
<p>When segments of the archaeological record are
combined, the picture emerges of an area rich in
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
traditional Southern lifeways. From dwellings and
patterns of yard use to foodways and the late
participation in a society based on consumption, the
archaeological record reveals a rural style of life that
changed little for a period of about 100 years. In this
regard, this area avoided the less desirable aspects
of changing popular American culture and allowed
local folk cultures to flourish. After the great depression
and World War II, all of this changed. Today
rural East-central Texas is not much different than
many other parts of the country, but has an archaeological heritage of which to be proud.</p>

major interpretive tool of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeologist">archaeologist</a>. Within
a given stratigraphic sequence the most deeply
buried layers are usually the oldest, and things found
within a given level were usually from the same
points in time. Stratigraphy is therefore a means of
telling time (in a relative sense) for the archaeologist.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b id="g_TestPits">Test Pits</b></i>: Rectilinear pits dug during excavation of a
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">site</a> (see <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_ArchaeologicalTesting">Archaeological Testing</a></i>). The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeologist">archaeologist</a>
works with square or rectangular pits because
they aid in keeping records of changes in soil types
and other variables with depth. Extensive records,
drawings and maps are kept of <a class="gloss" href="#g_TestPits">test pits</a>. The function
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_TestPits">test pit</a> is to provide a sample of a site&rsquo;s
contents at a particular point.</p>
<p class="tb"><i><b id="g_TestTrenches">Test Trenches</b></i>: Serving much the same function as a
<a class="gloss" href="#g_TestPits">test pit</a>, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_TestTrenches">test trench</a> give a more continuous record
of a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">site</a>&rsquo;s contents over a larger distance than a pit.
Trenches are useful for tracing <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stratigraphy">stratigraphy</a> (see
definition) over distance.</p>

<p class="tb">There are several organizations that encourage
interest and education in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a> by members
of the public. Some of these organizations are listed
below.</p>
<p class="tb">The first is the <i>Texas Archaeological Society,
Center for Archaeological Research, University of
Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78285</i>.
This society is composed of avocational archaeologists
from all walks of life. It holds an annual
meeting in the fall during which members present
papers on various aspects of Texas <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a>.
Each summer the society also organizes a field
school where members can participate in excavation
of an archaeological <a class="gloss" href="#g_Site">site</a> under the supervision
of a professional <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeologist">archaeologist</a>. The society
also publishes a high-quality bulletin about Texas
archaeology.</p>
<p class="tb">Another organization that promotes <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a>
is the <i>Archaeological Institute of America</i>. This
organization has its national headquarters in
Washington, D.C., and schedules national lecture
tours by archaeologists who visit local chapters in
major cities. The lectures are offered six times a
year, and present the results of archaeological investigations
world-wide.</p>
<p class="tb">In addition, local or county archaeological societies
can be contacted for information about
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a> in Texas. If such an organization does
not currently exist in your community, perhaps you
could start one!</p>
<p class="tb">Discovery of archaeological remains, particularly
destruction of archaeological properties,
deserves official attention. To report such events
and to obtain information about the State&rsquo;s efforts in
protecting archaeological and historical resources,
contact: <i>Texas Historical Commission, P.O. Box

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
